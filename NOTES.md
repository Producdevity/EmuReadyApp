# EmuReady Mobile App Development Notes

## Project Overview
Building a complete React Native Expo app for EmuReady - a platform for emulation gaming performance listings and reviews.

## Key Features to Implement
1. **Authentication** - Clerk integration for secure login
2. **Home Screen** - Featured listings, trending games, quick stats
3. **Browse/Search** - Games, systems, devices, emulators with filters
4. **Listing Details** - Performance data, comments, voting
5. **User Profile** - Personal listings, preferences, stats
6. **Create Listing** - Add new performance listings
7. **Notifications** - Real-time updates for interactions
8. **Offline Support** - Cache critical data

## Design Principles
- **Premium Feel**: Extensive micro-animations, smooth transitions
- **Mobile-First**: Touch-optimized, gesture-friendly
- **Intuitive UX**: Clear navigation, contextual actions
- **Performance**: Optimized lists, image loading, caching

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo
- **Navigation**: Expo Router (file-based)
- **Animations**: React Native Reanimated 3
- **UI**: Custom components with Tamagui/NativeWind
- **State**: Zustand for global state
- **API**: tRPC client connecting to existing backend
- **Auth**: Clerk Expo SDK
- **Images**: Expo Image with caching
- **Icons**: Expo Vector Icons + custom SVGs

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup ⏳
- [x] Install required dependencies
- [ ] Remove boilerplate code
- [ ] Setup project structure
- [ ] Configure tRPC client
- [ ] Setup Clerk authentication
- [ ] Create base UI components
- [ ] Setup navigation structure

### Phase 2: Core Features
- [ ] Authentication flow
- [ ] Home screen with featured content
- [ ] Browse/search functionality
- [ ] Listing details screen
- [ ] User profile screen

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Create listing flow
- [ ] Notifications system
- [ ] Offline support
- [ ] Performance optimizations

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing
- [ ] Micro-animations refinement
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] User experience testing
- [ ] Bug fixes and optimizations

## API Integration Notes
- Backend URL: Will need to be configured
- Authentication: Clerk tokens for API calls
- Endpoints: Use existing tRPC routers from web app
- Mobile-specific endpoints: Already created in backend

## Design System
- **Colors**: Match web app theme (blues, grays, accent colors)
- **Typography**: System fonts with proper scaling
- **Spacing**: 4px base unit system
- **Animations**: 200-300ms duration, easeInOut curves
- **Shadows**: Subtle elevation for cards/modals

## Current Status
- ✅ Project analyzed
- ✅ Notes file created
- ⏳ Starting Phase 1: Foundation Setup

## Next Steps
1. Install all required dependencies
2. Remove boilerplate code
3. Setup project structure
4. Configure tRPC and Clerk
